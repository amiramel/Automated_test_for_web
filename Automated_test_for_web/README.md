This library was inspired by "DroidMate" library - automated testing and dynamic analysis for Android applications.

The purpose of this library is to create automated testing and analysis of web-based systems.

There are a lot of web-based systems and also websites that do not have a system or code that can be run on them and will check them, find bugs and analyze them completely automatically.
In addition, this library will executing a process that is completely automated without any human intervention that will run automatically on the application, analyze the findings dynamically and find bugs or other unpleasant surprises in the system.

This library will be configured in a convenient development environment suitable for developing web applications and can be run over all different web programming languages.
The tests that can be run on web-based systems are screens connecting to the system, pressing certain buttons on the system and restarting the system.
